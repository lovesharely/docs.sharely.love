1. Overview of Sharely
Sharely is a Web3-native, mobile-first social commerce protocol designed for the AI era. In a world where AI agents are changing how users search, browse, and buy — traditional SEO and ad-based strategies are becoming less effective. Sharely offers a future-ready solution: shopping powered by trust, sharing, and incentives.

We believe consumption is labor — and labor should be rewarded. Every time you discover, buy, or share a product, you're creating downstream economic value. Sharely captures that value and redirects it back to the people who made it happen.
