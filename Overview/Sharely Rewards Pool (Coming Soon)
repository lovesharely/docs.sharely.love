🎯 Sharely Rewards Pool (Coming Soon)
The Sharely Rewards Pool is a pay-for-performance marketing engine that replaces traditional CAC with gamified engagement.

How it works:

Merchants fund a pool using stablecoins or $SHARE tokens.

Create “quests” — i.e., refer 3 friends, hit $100 GMV, complete a UGC post.

Users stake tokens to join and get rewarded only when tasks are completed.

All incentives are transparent, fair, and ROI-driven.
